# Intro to Data Engineering: Python Fundamentals

A 4-week intensive course designed to teach Python programming through the lens of data engineering. Students will learn foundational Python skills while building toward a capstone project: a complete banking transaction data pipeline.

---

## Course Overview

This course bridges the gap between basic programming knowledge and practical data engineering skills. By the end of the course, you'll be able to extract data from multiple sources, transform and clean it, and prepare it for database loading—all using Python.

### What You'll Build

Your capstone project will be a **Banking Transaction Data Pipeline** that:
- Extracts transaction data from multiple CSV sources
- Cleans and validates the data
- Calculates account balances and analytics
- Outputs SQL-ready data and JSON reports

---

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with programming concepts
- Some exposure to Python (variables, print statements)
- Basic understanding of SQL (SELECT, INSERT)
- A computer with internet access (we use browser-based tools)

---

## Tools & Environment

This course uses **browser-based Python environments** to eliminate setup friction:
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) - Recommended for beginners
- Any local Python 3.9+ installation works too

No installation required to get started!

- **Lecture 16** - Introduction to Data Engineering
- **Lecture 17** - Extract: Reading Multiple Data Sources
- **Lecture 18** - Transform: Data Cleaning & Enrichment
- **Lecture 19** - Load: Preparing Data for Database
- **Lecture 20** - Capstone: Banking Data Pipeline

**Section 4 Goal**: Complete a production-ready data pipeline

---

## Learning Approach

Each lecture follows this structure:

1. **Concept Introduction** - Clear explanation with real-world data engineering context
2. **Code Examples** - Working code you can run immediately
3. **Hands-On Challenge** - Practical exercise using financial/banking data
4. **Solution Review** - Detailed walkthrough of the solution

### Sample Challenge Progression

- **Section 1**: Clean a single transaction string
- **Section 2**: Process 100 transactions and calculate totals
- **Section 3**: Read transactions from CSV and export to JSON
- **Section 4**: Build a complete multi-source ETL pipeline
